## Architecture

### Frontend
- Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Uses shadcn-ui for accessible UI components
- Follows a well-structured component architecture

### Backend
- Python-based API built with FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL database
- Follows layered architecture with dependency injection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm (for local development)
- Python 3.12+ (for local development)
- Make (optional, for convenient commands)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RitechSolutions/genassist
cd genassist
```

## Docker Setup

GenAssist uses Docker Compose with a **base + override** pattern. See [docker/README.md](./docker/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### 1. Setup Environment Files

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.template frontend/.env
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# Edit the .env files with your configuration
```

### 2. Choose Your Development Approach

#### Option A: Full Stack in Docker

Run all services (backend, frontend, databases) in Docker containers.

```bash
# Using Make (recommended)
make dev              # Start everything
make dev-down         # Stop everything

# Using Docker Compose (from docker/ directory)
cd docker
docker compose --profile full up -d --build
docker compose --profile full down
```

#### Option B: Local Development with Docker Infrastructure

Run backend/frontend locally in your IDE, with only databases in Docker.

```bash
# Using Make (recommended)
make services         # Start infrastructure (db, redis, chroma, etc.)
make services-down    # Stop infrastructure

# Using Docker Compose (from docker/ directory)
cd docker
docker compose up -d db redis chroma qdrant whisper
docker compose down
```

#### Option C: Production Deployment

Use pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.base.yml -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile full up -d
```

### Available Make Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make dev` | Start full development stack |
| `make services` | Start infrastructure only |
| `make prod` | Start production stack |
| `make up-db` | Start only database |
| `make up-redis` | Start only Redis |
| `make up-core` | Start db + redis |
| `make logs-app` | View application logs |
| `make shell-app` | Shell into app container |
| `make clean` | Remove all containers |
| `make help` | Show all commands |

## Local Development

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of frontend similar to .env.example:
Follow Readme.md for frontend project

Access the frontend app at: http://localhost
User: admin
Password: genadmin

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of backend similar to .env.example:
Follow Readme.md for backend project

Access the backend API: http://localhost:8000/api
Access API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

Celery jobs: http://localhost:5555  (user:user1 password: password1)

## Integration Options

GenAssist provides multiple integration options:

### React Integration

```bash
#Build the plugin
cd plugins/react
npm run build

#Run chat plugin example
cd example-app
npm run dev
```

### JavaScript Widget (Standalone)

A self-contained IIFE widget that can be embedded into any website (e.g., help centers, landing pages) without a framework. It bundles React, styles, and fonts into a single JS + CSS pair.

```bash
cd plugins/plugin-js
cp src/config/config.example.js src/config/config.js  # create your local config
npm install
npm run build
```

For full setup instructions, configuration options, and custom font usage, see the [plugin-js README](./plugins/plugin-js/README.md).

### iOS Integration

```bash
#Build the plugin
cd plugins/ios
```

## UI Test Automation

```bash
# Frontend Tests
cd ui_tests

npx playwright install
npx playwright test
```

## Backend Testing

```bash
# Backend Tests
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source=app -m pytest -v tests && coverage report -m

# Detailed coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=html
```
